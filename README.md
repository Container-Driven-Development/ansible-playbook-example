# Ansible Playbook Example

Example playbook üéÅ in docker image, this image is based on https://github.com/Container-Driven-Development/ansible-playbook-base, us base dir or just take it as an inspiration and create completely own Dockerfile. 

Just go ahead and try run this example docker image against your playbook it will just print host ansible variables.

## Why?

1. Modern CI ready.
2. Caching - Ansible roles baked in docker image upfront.
3. Reproducible runs with same ansible, python libraries, roles, ansible.cfg, playbooks.

# How does it work?

1. Build docker image including everything needed for playbook to be executed ( ansible, python libraries, roles, ansible.cfg and playbooks )
2. Run this docker image with mounted inventory.yml and id_rsa key from you local or CI
3. Profit üé©

## Run wrapped playbook

```
$ docker run -it \
-v $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa:/home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa \
-v /path/to/inventory.yml:/ansible/inventory.yml \
docker.io/devincan/ansible-playbook-example:v0.1 \
-v -e global_test_variable=test
```

## Use wrapped playbook in Gitlab CI

```yaml
ansible-playbook-example:
  stage: example
  image: 
    name: docker.io/devincan/ansible-playbook-example:v0.1
    entrypoint: [""]
  script:
  - /entrypoint.sh
  variables:
    OPTIONS: "-e global_test_variable=test"
```

## Developing playbook

Simply mounting your own playbook into `/ansible-playbook` will allow you to run docker image with your changes without need to rebuild image each time.

```
$ ansible-galaxy install -r /ansible-playbook/requirements.yml -p /ansible-playbook/roles --force

$ docker run -it \
-v $PWD:/ansible-playbook \
-v $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa:/home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa \
-v /path/to/inventory.yml:/ansible/inventory.yml \
docker.io/devincan/ansible-playbook-example:v0.1 \
-v -e global_test_variable=test
```
